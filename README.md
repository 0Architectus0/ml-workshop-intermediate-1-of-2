Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python that is used by many data science practitioners. In this workshop, we will learn about cross validation, tuning machine learning algorithms, pandas interoperability, and handling missing values. Cross validation enables us to evaluate our machine learning models by splitting our data into multiple training and testing datasets. Hyper-parameter tuning helps us find parameter combinations that are suited for your data. Scikit-learn's ColumnTransformer is used to handle heterogenous data provided as a panda's DataFrame. Furthermore, scikit-learn provides univariate and K-Nearest Neighbor transformers for imputing missing values in our datasets.
